This is the alternative splicing pipeline we have created for our group project. The data folder holds the .sam and .bam files along with a link to download the .gtf file we used in our pipeline. The src folder holds the code we wrote to convert a fastq file to a .sam, zip.py is in one ec2 instance and compress the .sam to a .bam using samtools, and splice.py is used in the second instance to find the splice junctions using SPLICE-q.
